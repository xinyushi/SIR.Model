    "One extension model we propose is to apply these two model into Covid-19 real data. The ultimate purpose for a model is to serve the application, and coronavirus is best example we can use and care recently. What I propose is to input the N(population) as the US total population, I(Infectious people) and R(recovered people) to the model, as well the statistical k(infectious probability) and b(recover rates) from research as a baseline. After that, we can change the k, b, T(Days to simulate) and test how these simulation process will change visually, aiming to find the optimized solution to cool down the cases. At the same time, we might need to consider to add death rate variable to improve the results of the model. Essentially, we hope to use the agent-based model and ODE model to seek for the best way to drop down the cases given a different range of T.\n",

Alternatively, we could let people who are recovered becomes susceptible with certain probability. For ODE model, this could be implement by adding probability of reinfection `r`.
