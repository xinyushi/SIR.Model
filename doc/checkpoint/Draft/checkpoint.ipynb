    "One extension model we propose is to apply these two models into Covid-19 real data. The ultimate purpose for a model is to serve for real world application, and coronavirus is the best example we can use and really care recently. What I propose is to input the N(population) as the US total population, I(Infectious people) and R(recovered people) to the model, as well the average b(number of contacts) and k(recover rates) from research as a baseline. After that, we can change the b, T(Days to simulate) and test how these simulations process will change visually, aiming to find the optimized solution to cool down the cases. At the same time, we can also consider recovery rates in different age and gender to find more targeted results. For instance, we can model school disease spread to decide if it is wise to reopen the school. Essentially, we hope to use the agent-based model and ODE model to seek for the best way to drop down the cases given a different range of T.\n",

For Agent-Based model, this could be implemented by adding probability of reinfection, where reinfected people would be infected again. Alternatively, we could let people who are recovered becomes susceptible with certain probability. In addition, we could add a new variable `immunization`. This variable stores the probability of been immunized from the disease. For example, `immunization = 0.2` means 80% chance of been reinfection. The value increases if individuals recover from the disease. For ODE model, this could be implement by adding probability of reinfection `r`. Then the model could becomes \n",

For ODE model, we can implement it by reducing the parameter b.
